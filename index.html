                    <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>In Nashville, chef Andy Little of Josephine dares to step away from the classic whole <br>roasted chicken,ditching the oven for a different appliance. The result is simply unparalleled. The whole chicken is grined for twenty-four hours, then allowed to dry overnight. This allows the chicken to get extra crispy when fried.  The whole bird is then deep-fried instead , of oven-roasted to produce a juicy, flavor-filled interior encased by crispy, golden skin. The Josephine Whole Chicken for 2 has become an irreplaceable  staple on the rotation of seasonal menus throughout the years. Served on a bed of crispy potatoes and kale topped with a grilled onion vinaigrette, the dish is a sophisticated play on both flavor and texture. “This dish ties back to the agrarian roots of my upbringing by using the whole animal, but speaks to the flavors of the south in its unique deep fryer taste,” Little says.</p>
